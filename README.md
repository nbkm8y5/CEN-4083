Notes for cloud computing course
##Week One
>Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources ( e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models and four deployment models.

###Virtualization - Technical Perspective

####Application

* Hosted on a single machine

* Cheaper to deliver to end user because cost are shared among the users.

* Users do not need high grade systems to run application

* If data stored on cloud, users can access data from any device(mobile or browser)

####Server

* Uses common physical hardward (networks, storage or computing machines) to host virtual machines

* Physical host machines could have any number of virtual machines running on it

* Virtual machines could be hosted using their own OS, and their own set of applications

* Cost benefits include consolidation of a large number of physical machines onto fewer physical machines that host the virtual machines

* Increased efficiency in less space, maintenance, cooling and electricity costs.

* Elasticity: Pooling a set of virtual machines together when they can join/leave the pool of other virtual machines so that scalability is automated and on-demand.

###Cloud Services

* Definition of a service: “a collection of IT systems, components, and resources that work together to provide value to users.”

* Two parameters used to asses a service:

  * Cost
  * SLA (Service Level Agreement)

* Service Level Agreement (SLA)

  * Contract between service consumer and the service supplier
  * Terms: Service delivery time frame (when), its quality (what) and scope (where and how much).

* Operational Level Agreement (OLA)

  * If consumer is internal to service supplier company, then internal agreement is considered an operational level agreement.

* Service Level Objectives (SLO)

  * Objectives, or metrics user to monitor performance and auditing of the system.
  * Used to measure specific characteristics of SLA.

###Cloud Service models

* Business Architecture

  * Business Process as a Service

* Information Architecture

  * Information as a Service

* Application Architecture

  * Software as a Service

* Technology Architecture

  * Platform as a Service

  * Infrastructure as a Service
