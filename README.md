Notes for cloud computing course
##Week One
>Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources ( e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models and four deployment models.

###Virtualization - Technical Perspective

####Application

* Hosted on a single machine

* Cheaper to deliver to end user because cost are shared among the users.

* Users do not need high grade systems to run application

* If data stored on cloud, users can access data from any device(mobile or browser)

####Server

* Uses common physical hardward (networks, storage or computing machines) to host virtual machines

* Physical host machines could have any number of virtual machines running on it

* Virtual machines could be hosted using their own OS, and their own set of applications

* Cost benefits include consolidation of a large number of physical machines onto fewer physical machines that host the virtual machines

* Increased efficiency in less space, maintenance, cooling and electricity costs.

* Elasticity: Pooling a set of virtual machines together when they can join/leave the pool of other virtual machines so that scalability is automated and on-demand.
